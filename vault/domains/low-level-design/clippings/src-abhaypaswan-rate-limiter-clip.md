# lld-python/problems/rate-limiter at main · abhaypaswan/lld-python

**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium · **Time:** ~50 min · **Patterns:** Strategy

Four algorithms that answer the same question and disagree about the answer. The design work is small; the value is in knowing which one to reach for and being able to say what each one gets wrong.

Limit how many requests a client may make in a period of time. Reject the rest, and tell the caller when to come back.

1. Allow at most N requests per client per window.
2. Each client has their own budget.
3. A rejection says how long to wait before retrying.
4. Support four algorithms — **token bucket** ,**fixed window** ,**sliding
window log** ,**sliding window counter** — behind one interface.
5. A rejected request must not consume budget or push the recovery time out.
6. A request may cost more than one unit.

- Single process, in memory. Distributing it is the main follow-up.
- The client key is any hashable: a user id, an API key, an IP.
- The clock is monotonic and injected.

    | Algorithm | Memory per client | Bursts | Accuracy | Use when | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Token bucket** | 2 floats | **Allowed on purpose** | Exact | Public APIs. Idle clients bank credit. | 
| **Fixed window** | 2 ints | Boundary burst, up to 2× | Poor at edges | Cheap counting where a 2× overshoot is survivable. | 
| **Sliding log** | O(limit) timestamps | None | Exact | Low limits where precision matters. | 
| **Sliding counter** | 3 ints | Smoothed | ≈ exact, errs strict | The usual production default. | 

Run `python3 src/main.py` and the difference is one line of output:

```
Traffic: 5 requests at t=9.9s, then 5 more at t=10.1s. Limit is 5 per 10s.
  token-bucket             .....xxxxx   5/10 allowed
  fixed-window             ..........   10/10 allowed
  sliding-window-log       .....xxxxx   5/10 allowed
  sliding-window-counter   .....xxxxx   5/10 allowed
```
That 10/10 is the **boundary burst**, and it is the single most useful thing to
be able to name in this interview.

All four algorithms answer one question — may this request through right now? — and differ only in how they remember the recent past. That difference is entirely a memory-versus-accuracy trade. It belongs behind one interface, not in four kinds of limiter.

Every one of these is a time-based algorithm, and a time-based algorithm that
reads its own clock can only be tested by sleeping. Passing `now` in means the
whole suite runs in milliseconds and every assertion about refill rates and
window boundaries is exact.

Nothing is scheduled and no timer runs. Tokens are derived from elapsed time on each call:

`self._tokens = min(self.capacity, self._tokens + elapsed * self.refill_rate)`
An idle client therefore costs nothing to maintain, which is what makes this
viable at a million clients. It also means a backwards clock must be handled
explicitly — otherwise a negative `elapsed` mints tokens out of nothing.

`capacity` is separate from `limit` so burst size and sustained rate can be set
independently: 60 per minute sustained, never more than 5 back to back.

`estimate = previous_count * (1 - elapsed_fraction) + current_count`
Thirty seconds into a sixty-second window, half of the previous window still counts. That kills the boundary burst without storing a timestamp per request.

It is an approximation and it **errs strict**: it assumes the previous window's
requests were spread evenly, so a client who bunched them all at the start gets
rejected slightly early. For a rate limiter, early is the safe direction to be
wrong in — and there is a test that pins that behaviour down rather than
letting it look like a bug.

Buckets are created lazily per client, which is right. But without eviction, every key ever seen keeps a bucket forever.

`forget_idle` handles it, and refuses an interval shorter than one window —
dropping a bucket resets that client's budget, so forgetting too eagerly lets a
client clear their own limit by pausing briefly. In production this job usually
goes to a TTL on the backing store, but the constraint is the same wherever it
lives.

`cd problems/rate-limiter && python3 src/main.py``python3 -m pytest problems/rate-limiter -v`
The shared behaviours are parameterised across all four algorithms, so a new
algorithm inherits the whole contract by being added to one list. The
differences then get their own named tests — including one that asserts the
fixed window *does* allow the boundary burst, so the fix can be shown to fix it.

- **Distribute it across servers.** The counter moves to Redis, and the
read-modify-write becomes a race — a Lua script or`INCR` with an expiry.
Token bucket distributes worst because it is the most stateful.
- **Different limits per tier.** Free 100/hour, paid 10,000/hour. Does the
limiter look the limit up, or does the caller pass it in?
- **Limit by several keys at once** — per user*and* per IP*and* per endpoint.
All must pass; which rejection do you report?
- **What happens when the limiter itself is down?** Fail open or fail closed?
For billing, closed. For a login page, probably open.
- **Why not a leaky bucket?** It shapes traffic to a constant output rate
rather than gating admission — a queue, not a limiter.
- **Return standard headers.**`X-RateLimit-Remaining` and`Retry-After` are
already on`Decision` .
