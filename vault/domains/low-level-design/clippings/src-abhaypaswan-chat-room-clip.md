# lld-python/problems/chat-room at main · abhaypaswan/lld-python

**Difficulty:** 🟡 Medium · **Time:** ~50 min · **Patterns:** Mediator, Observer, Facade

The textbook Mediator problem, and a good one because the alternative is so tempting. Letting users hold references to each other works perfectly for two people and collapses at ten.

Build a chat system: users join rooms, send messages to everyone or to one person, and can block people they would rather not hear from.

1. Users join and leave rooms; a user can be in several at once.
2. A message reaches everyone in the room except the sender.
3. Direct messages reach one person.
4. A user can block another; blocked messages never arrive.
5. Rooms can mute a user and reject banned words.
6. Rooms keep a transcript, and a late joiner sees the backlog.
7. Users must not hold references to each other.

- Single process, in memory. A broker is the scaling follow-up.
- Delivery is synchronous into an in-memory inbox.
- Names are unique across the server.

        +whisper(room, to, body) Delivery
        +receive(message)
        +block(name)
    }
    class Message {
        <<frozen dataclass>>
        +str sender
        +str body
        +MessageType message_type
        +str recipient
        +render() str
    }
    class Delivery {
        <<frozen dataclass>>
        +Message message
        +tuple delivered_to
        +tuple withheld_from
        +str reason
        +reach int
    }
    ChatServer o-- "*" ChatRoom
    ChatServer o-- "*" User
    ChatRoom o-- "*" User : members
    ChatRoom o-- "*" Message : history
    ChatRoom ..> Delivery : returns
    User ..> ChatRoom : talks to
    User o-- "*" Message : inbox
    Delivery o-- Message
```
    Note what is **not** on that diagram: any line from `User` to `User`.

Without a mediator, each user holds a reference to every other user in the
room. That is `N × (N−1)` references, and every one of them has to be created
on join and torn down on leave:

| Members | Peer-to-peer references | With a mediator | 
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 12 | 4 | 
| 10 | 90 | 10 | 
| 50 | 2,450 | 50 | 

The count is the least of it. The real cost is that *every* rule about two
users — blocking, muting, moderation — has to be enforced by one of the two
parties, and neither is the right place for it:

- The **sender** cannot enforce a block. It must not learn who blocked it.
- The **recipient** enforcing it means filtering after delivery, so the
message was already sent.

So the rule goes in the room. `_fan_out` skips the sender, checks each
recipient's block list, and reports what happened. Neither user knows.

They look similar and are used for different things. Worth being able to state the difference:

|  | Observer | Mediator | 
|---|---|---|
| Shape | one-to-many | many-to-many | 
| Subject knows | nothing about listeners | everything about participants | 
| Logic | none — it just notifies | routing, filtering, moderation | 
| Listeners | may be anything | are the participants | 

If the room merely fanned messages out, Observer would be right. But it decides
*who gets what*: it skips the sender, applies blocks, enforces mutes, rejects
banned words, and owns the transcript. That is a mediator, and putting any of
it on a Subject would be a mistake.

The `User` class is the giveaway. Look at what it does not have:

```
class User:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.inbox = []
        self.blocked = set()
        self._rooms = []  # mediators, not peers
```
No peer list. No `send_to(other_user)`. A test asserts it, because this is the
sort of thing that erodes the first time someone adds a feature in a hurry.

```
carol.block("alice")  # carol states the preference
alice.send(room, "hello")  # the room applies it
# -> delivered to 1, withheld from 1
```
Alice's send **succeeds**. It just reaches fewer people. She is not told who
withheld it — which is the point of blocking, and a detail that is easy to
leak through an error message.

Every other path records to `history`. `send_direct` deliberately does not,
because the transcript is replayed to everyone who joins later, and a private
message in it is a privacy breach that ships silently.

That asymmetry is exactly the kind of thing to write a test for, because the "obvious" refactor — record everything in one place — reintroduces the bug.

```
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Delivery:
    delivered_to: tuple[str, ...]
    withheld_from: tuple[str, ...]
    reason: str
```
A muted user's message is not an exception — being muted is normal — but it is
also not a success. Returning `None` and hoping makes "why did nobody see my
message?" the hardest class of chat bug to diagnose. The reason travels back
with the result.

`cd problems/chat-room && python3 src/main.py````
1. Four people join #general. Each knows the room, not each other.
   members: alice, bob, carol, dave
   peer-to-peer would need 12 references; the mediator needs 4
3. carol blocks alice. The room enforces it; alice is not told who.
   delivered to 2, withheld from 1
   bob sees:   <alice> anyone up for lunch?
   carol sees: <alice> morning all   <- unchanged
4. A direct message goes to one person, and stays out of history.
   dave sees:  [bob → dave] want to grab coffee?
   in transcript: False
5. Moderation lives in the room, because it is about a relationship.
   not delivered (message blocked ('spoiler' is not allowed here))
   not delivered (dave is muted in general)
```
`python3 -m pytest problems/chat-room -v`
- **Threads and replies.** A message now needs a parent, and the transcript
stops being a flat list.
- **Read receipts and typing indicators.** These are genuinely Observer —
high-frequency, low-value events that should not go through the same path as
messages.
- **Editing and deleting messages.**`Message` is frozen; what replaces it, and
what does the transcript keep?
- **Several servers.** The room can no longer hold every member in a dict. A
broker does the fan-out, and the mediator becomes a routing decision.
- **End-to-end encryption.** The room can no longer read message bodies — so
banned-word moderation stops working. What can a mediator still do when it
cannot see the content?
- **Rate limiting per user** , to stop flooding. Another rule about a
relationship, so another thing that belongs in the room.
